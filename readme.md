## SOLID Principles Examples in PHP

### Single Responsibility Principle ([Example](./1-single-responsibility-principle.php))
This principle is about **actors and high level architecture**.
> A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

### Open Closed Principle
This principle is about **class design and feature extensions**.
> A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
> Don't change the same class over and over. If you find this happening, abstract out what is changing

### Liskov Substitution
This principle is about **subtyping and inheritance**
> Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

### Interface Segregation Principle
This principle is about **business logic to clients communication**.
> Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

### Dependency Inversion Principle
This principle wires up all **other four principles in a single circle**.
> Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.
